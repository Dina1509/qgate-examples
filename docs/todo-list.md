 # TODO list
 
1. Command line for graph generation (perf and exec)
  - expected qgate-perf
2. Add to the outputs also samples from PERF and EXE graphs
3. Implementation of 99 percentile, 95 percentile
4. Time measurement with better precision
5. Console output with shorter form (number precision 4 places,
   datetime only with time)
6. Time for Cluster health check improvement (default can be ok)
